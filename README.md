Topic: Online Store Simulator

Description:
In this project, students will create a command-line program that simulates an online store. The program will allow users to view items for sale, add items to their cart, and checkout. The program will also keep track of inventory levels and update them as items are sold. Students will implement object-oriented programming concepts, file I/O, and exception handling.

Requirements:

Users should be able to view a list of items for sale, including the item name, price, and quantity available.
Users should be able to add items to their cart and remove them if desired.
Users should be able to checkout, which will calculate the total price of the items in their cart and update the inventory levels.
The program should read in item data from a text file and write updated inventory levels to the same file.
The program should handle errors gracefully, such as when a user tries to add more items to their cart than are available.
The program should have a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and feedback.
